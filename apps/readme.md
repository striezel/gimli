# gimli - the Generic Image Library

gimli is a library that can load common image formats (such as JPEG or PNG)
and perform some basic operations on them.

_Note: The library is still in an early stage of development. So far it has only
very few features._

Furthermore, some example applications are provided that make use of the library
and its features. Currently, this includes the following applications:

* [`gandalf-the-grey`](./gandalf_the_grey/readme.md) - produces greyscale
  versions of images
* [`gandalf-the-white`](./gandalf_the_white/readme.md) - produces
  white-balanced versions of images
* [`gimli`](./gimli/readme.md) - finds like images by hashes
* [`hobbit`](./hobbit/readme.md) - resizes images to smaller (or larger)
  dimensions
